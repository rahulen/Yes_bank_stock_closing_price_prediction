# Yes_bank_stock_closing_price_prediction
This project aims to predict the closing price of Yes Bankâ€™s stock using historical data and machine learning regression models.

Yes Bank, a prominent private sector bank in India, has seen significant volatility, especially after 2018 due to fraud allegations involving Rana Kapoor. As stock prices are influenced by both financial performance and market sentiment, this makes Yes Bank an interesting case for modeling stock behavior.

 Potential Enhancements:
Time Series Models: Like ARIMA, LSTM could better capture temporal dependencies.

Sentiment Analysis: Including financial news or social media sentiment.

Feature Engineering: Adding technical indicators like RSI, MACD, etc.
